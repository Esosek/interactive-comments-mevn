## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

#### Frontend

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. React focuses on creating reusable UI components.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React-based framework for building web applications with features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes for handling backend functionality.
- [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/) - A small, fast state management library for React that provides a minimalistic API for managing global state in applications.
- [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css#css-modules) - A CSS file in which all class and animation names are scoped locally by default. This is used to avoid conflicts in styles across the project.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types, improving developer experience and reducing runtime errors in JavaScript applications.

#### Backend

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) - A lightweight WSGI web framework for Python, offering tools, libraries, and technologies to build web applications easily.
- [Graphene](https://graphene-python.org/) - A Python library used to build GraphQL APIs, making it easy to implement a GraphQL schema in a Python backend.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) - A C-based lightweight, serverless database engine that's embedded into applications. It is ideal for smaller-scale applications or development environments.
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - A powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, allowing developers to interact with databases in a Pythonic way.

### What I learned

I learned how to create a simple GraphQL API with Flask, Graphene and SQLAlchemy. I also dived deeper into Zustand. I'm proud of the React frontend structure.

### Continued development

I will be focusing on finding a backend stack that I'm comfortable with. Currently experimenting with MEVN stack where I would also like to practice Vue.js.
